## Import Utility

We've created an importer utility that accepts a `.csv` document and generates `.md` files for the `results`, `subjects`, `areas`, and `grades` collections. 

To run the importer using the default config;
```
cd importer
npm install
cd ../
npm run import-results
```
This assumes your `csv` is at `/data/results.csv` and you want to spit out markdown files to `src/results`. We've included a `results-template.xls` file as a guide for how the import expects your data to be structured. When your data is ready, save the first sheet in the workbook as a `csv`. We've included a sample `results-sample.csv` that shows how the importer expects to receive data.

Running `npm run import` allows you to specify options for `--source` (location of import csv) and `--clean` (removed data from all import collections) as well. Run `npm import -- --help` for a full list of options.

Running `npm run import-results` will remove all of the existing import collection data from the codebase, and replace it with the data imported from `data/results.csv`.
