subject: "math"
grade: "3"
area: "umr"
next_steps:
  - instructions: "With your student, create an equation with two operations and an unknown number, for example, 2 x 3 + b = 10, then have your student represent the equation as a story problem. "
  - instructions: "With your student, classify quadrilaterals as squares, rectangles, trapezoids, parallelograms, or none of these; and create measurement problems involving distance, time, volume, and money. "
  - instructions: "With your student, estimate answers to word problems by rounding. Discuss what level of rounding is appropriate (for example, to the nearest dollar or nearest 10 dollars). "
  - instructions: "With your student, make predictions about operations with fractions and whole numbers, and then test your predictions. For example, what happens when you add two fractions less than 1? "
  - instructions: "With your student, use coins to convert between decimals and fractions; for example, 3 quarters = $0.75, so 3/4 = 0.75. Use this reasoning to compare fractions like 3/4 and 8/10 using decimals."
