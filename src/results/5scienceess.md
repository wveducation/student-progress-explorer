  - instructions: "With your student, discuss the producers, consumers, decomposers, and nonliving matter in a familiar ecosystem. Analyze how the organisms’ traits support their survival in the ecosystem. Predict how organisms would survive in different environments. Search “ecosystem cycles” online to support the discussion. "
  - instructions: "With your student, design and conduct an experiment to show if mixing kitchen substances causes chemical changes. Substances may include water, vinegar, baking soda, and salt. Search “virtual lab chemical changes” online for a list of data to collect. Push objects to see how motion changes when forces are applied. "
  - instructions: "With your student, find a stream or pond. Record observations of living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. Discuss how matter moves between organisms and the environment, and how water changed the land over time. Then, search “nutrient cycling” and “rock cycle and water erosion” online to further the discussion."
